          I started freelancing in 2022, working on various projects that
          involved web development, and more. This experience helped me build a
          strong foundation in software engineering and client communication.
          Unfortunately, there was not much remaining time for freelancing
          because of my full-time job, but below is the list of projects I
          worked on:
          <FreelancingProjects />
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default FreelancingRenderer;
