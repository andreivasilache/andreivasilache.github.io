          I’m curious by nature and always looking for ways to make life a
          little smarter and easier through technology. I love exploring new
          ideas, whether it’s experimenting with AI, building apps, or dreaming
          up projects that could one day grow into something bigger.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of work, I love traveling, listening, and engaging in interesting
          conversations that spark new ideas. I’m passionate about helping others,
          and this site is a space where I share a bit of who I am and the projects
          I’m working on to make a positive impact.
